<h1> Dojos-and-Ninjas </h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        ü•∑üèª‚öîÔ∏è An application that manages a database to dojos in certain cities/states &amp; the ninjas that attend each of those dojos respectively.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2> Purpose/Technical Use: </h2>
<p>
The purpose & technical use of this project can be for a framework to set up databases for a parent company that owns many dojos to utilize. With this they can keep track of the dojos that are signed up under them or ones they‚Äôve acquired/bought, keep track of ninjas that are members in specific dojos. manage new ninjas(members) joining, update info for current ninjas(members) when needed, and delete the ninjas(members) that are not renewing their memberships to the dojos or canceling their memberships.
</p>

<h2> How it works: </h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        This is done using the MySQL Workbench with a one to many relationship, SQL script file, and SQL queries that initiate the actions needed to be made to/from the database.
    </li>
    <li>
        Using CRUD, we run queries to create(insert), read(select), update(update), and/or delete(delete) data in the database tables.            All the interactions between the database are then shown respectively onto the pages/application in real time as you enter inputs         and explore it. This is accomplished by using Session in the backend controller (MVC) and Jinja2 on the HTML pages.
    </li>
</ul>
