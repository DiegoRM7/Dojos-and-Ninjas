# Dojos-and-Ninjas
  -  ü•∑üèª‚öîÔ∏è An application that manages a database to dojos in certain cities/states &amp; the ninjas that attend each of those dojos respectively.

# Purpose/Technical Use:
  -  This project can be a framework to set up databases for keeping track of the dojos that are signed up onto specific dojos.
     A parent company to all the dojos can use this to keep records of new ninjas(members) joining, updating ninjas(members) info when needed, and deleting the ninjas(members)
     that are not renewing their memberships to the dojos or cancelling their memberships.

# How it works:
  -  This is done using the MySQL Workbench with a one to many relationship, SQL script file, and SQL queries that initiate the actions needed to be made to/from the database.
    -  Using CRUD, we run queries to create(insert), read(select), update(update), and/or delete(delete) data in the database tables.
  -  All the interactions between the dabase is then shown respectively onto the pages/application as you enter inputs and explore it.
